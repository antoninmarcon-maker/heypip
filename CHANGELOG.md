# Changelog

## 0.1.3

- The call no longer leaks into « You »: a leak through headphones (or the echo from speakers) used to come out as
  « You » lines, often as the first line of a meeting. The « You » transcription now only hears the microphone when it
  is clearly louder than the call's echo, measured during the meeting; `you.m4a` still records everything.
- The « No agent is reading » message shows again when the agent switch is turned back on during a meeting.
- For contributors: `--replay you.m4a them.m4a` plays a recorded call through Pip silently (send both tracks with an
  echo bug report), `PIP_TRACE` logs the decisions.

## 0.1.2

- Pip says when no agent is reading the feed: with the agent switch on and nobody following `agent-feed.md` after
  20 seconds, a message in the notch (« No agent is reading · type /pip in Claude Code ») and a warning in the island.
- `transcript.md` lines are written in time order (a « Them » line no longer lands before an older « You » line).
- `/pip summary [folder]`: summarises a meeting recorded without an agent, from its `transcript.md`.
- During the call, « Claude, … » asks the agent directly; the answer comes as the next note.
- Update the `/pip` command to get the last two:
  `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjksens/heypip/main/integrations/claude-code/pip/SKILL.md -o ~/.claude/skills/pip/SKILL.md`

## 0.1.1

- A small star in the island, next to the settings: it opens Pip's GitHub page, then turns yellow once clicked.

## 0.1.0

First public version.

- The island in the notch: hover to open, click to keep open, right-click for the menu.
- A little printed Pip on the left of the notch shows where Pip lives (can be hidden from the menu).
- Or Pip in the menu bar instead of the notch (a setting): click its icon to open the island under it; notes and the
  recording time show there too.
- Pip and its states: ready, getting ready, listening, nobody talking, paused, a note for you, saved, a problem.
- Live transcription, sentence by sentence: on device with SpeechAnalyzer on macOS 26; on macOS 15 the previous recognizer,
  on device when your language's model is available, otherwise through Apple's servers.
- You (microphone) and Them (the call's audio) on separate tracks.
- Agent switch: the agent only sees `agent-feed.md`, only while it is on.
- Pause, vocabulary, transcription and interface language (English, French).
- Asks for the microphone before the first recording, and restarts the capture by itself if one side stops sending
  audio (microphone changed, AirPods switching to call mode); a recording keeps one format when the microphone changes.
- The `/pip` command for Claude Code: follows the call, whispers notes, writes the summary.
- Without headphones, the call's echo is removed from You (word by word: what you say over the call is kept).
- Recent meetings: click the meeting's name in the island to look back at one or start a new one; a meeting never
  overwrites another one.

Best with headphones: without them your voice mixed with the speakers is recognised a little less well.
